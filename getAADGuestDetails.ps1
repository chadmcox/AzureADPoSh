    Gathers all Guest Accounts in Azure AD Instance

    Azure AD is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you to invite people from 
     outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account. Until you have a business need 
     to provide guest access to any user, avoid creating such guest users. Guest users are typically 
     added out of your employee on-boarding/off-boarding process and could potentially be lying there 
     unnoticed indefinitely leading to a potential vulnerability.
